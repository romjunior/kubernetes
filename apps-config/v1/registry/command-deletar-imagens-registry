1) Update registry configuration file (config.yml) and restart registry

storage:
    delete:
        enabled: true
OU
 ENV = REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true

2) Get tags list

GET ://<registry_host>/v2/<repo_name>/tags/list

3) Get manifest for selected tag

GET ://<registry_host>/v2/<repo_name>/manifests/<tag_name>

curl -v -sSL -k -H 'Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json' -X GET https://<registry_host>/v2/<repo_name>/manifests/<tag_name>


4) Copy digest hash from response header

Docker-Content-Digest: <digest_hash>

5) Delete manifest (soft delete). This request only marks image tag as deleted and doesn't delete files from file system. If you want to delete data from file system, run this step and go to the next step

DELETE ://<registry_host>/v2/<repo_name>/manifests/<digest_hash>

curl -v -sSL -k -H "Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json" -X  DELETE https://<registry_host>/v2/<repo_name>/manifests/<digest_hash>


Note! You must set headers for request - Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json

6) Delete image data from file system

Run command from the host machine:

docker exec -it <registry_container_id> bin/registry garbage-collect <path_to_registry_config>

Note! Usually, <path_to_registry_config>=/etc/docker/registry/config.yml
