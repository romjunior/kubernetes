Edit the daemon.json file, whose default location is /etc/docker/daemon.json on Linux or 
C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json on Windows Server. If you use Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows, 
click the Docker icon, choose Preferences, and choose +Daemon.

If the daemon.json file does not exist, create it. 
Assuming there are no other settings in the file, 
it should have the following contents:

{
  "insecure-registries" : ["myregistrydomain.com:5000"]
}
